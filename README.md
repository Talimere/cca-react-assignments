Clone this repository to a folder (directory) of your choosing!

Use your terminal/cmd to navigate to a folder, and run the `git clone <repository url>` command to clone this repository to your local computer.

You can find the repository url on the green `Clone` button up in the right corner.

When I notify you that I've made an update, you can run the `git pull` command in the terminal/cmd while you're in the repository root folder.
